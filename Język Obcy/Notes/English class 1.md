2A:
Read the introduction to Is failure good for you?. What opinions might you find in the article? Scan the article to check.

>Probably i can find opinions for and against failing. Some people will take it as good opportunity to learn and failure just push them to do more work. And for some of them it will be demotivating and will make them weaker then before.

2B:
Which reporter holds a different view from the others? How is it different?
>Different opinion has the forth reporter - Jay Masters. He stated that failing is not good for everyone. he pointed that it can make u loose your confidence, money or even job. He encourages to prepare better in order to not fail at all.

1. feels more strongly about the topic than the others? How do you know? 
>
2. agrees with Kate that some often- repeated phrases are untrue? 

>Jay Masters.
>"I, for one, simply cannot stand all these vacuous comments and sweeping statements we get on social media, like ‘Failing is part of the journey’."
3. is motivated to question their own attitudes by another’s comments?
>???
4. mentions an alternative career option? 
>Kate Quinn
>"Give it a good go, but give up if you clearly don’t have what it takes. Had I not accepted that I wasn’t cut out to be a crime writer (seventy-one rejection letters!), I wouldn’t be enjoying the rewards of being a reporter now!"

5. compares two differing attitudes to failure from real experiences? 
>Ethan Knowles
>"He admitted really resenting it and the sense of failure it brought, however constructive it was intended to be."
>
>"They are mixed. If I do my best and then get a critical reaction, the feeling of failure can be galling."

6. agrees with Molls that failing at something can in fact open up new opportunities?
>Molls
>"Failing can, and should, be a positive in that it makes you reassess and perhaps change tack, and I think this generation of young people are much better at dealing with it than mine was."

>Kate Quinn
>"Give it a good go, but give up if you clearly don’t have what it takes. Had I not accepted that I wasn’t cut out to be a crime writer (seventy-one rejection letters!), I wouldn’t be enjoying the rewards of being a reporter now!"
